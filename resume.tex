\tagline{Amazing tag line that makes HR managers want to hire you immediately.\\The tag line is aligned with the bottom of the picture to the right, so if you have\\multiple lines it fills the space to your name from the bottom. You might want to\\introduce manual line breaks to make this look nicer then simply filling up the lines.}

% make photo exactly match the header with margintop/marginright/marginbottom as margin
% \photo[round]{picture.jpg}{\dimexpr \headerheight-\marginbottom}

% with option noborder, the image size is set by the header height and not the image size parameter!
% instead, this parameter is misused to fine-tune the alignment, e.g. shift the photo up by 0.4mm
\photo[noborder]{picture.jpg}{0.4mm}

    \section{Another section}
    
    This page uses the page style \texttt{highlightmain} which shows the highlight bar (gray) and the main part (white background) but omits the header. 
    The default page style is \texttt{headerhighlightmain} with all three elements.
    If you don't want header, nor highlight bar, use page style \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}}.
    \medskip
    Neither main, nor highlight bar must be filled to make this template work.
    It is possible to use a page style with the highlight bar but leave it empty by setting an empty highlightbar \texttt{\textbackslash highlightbar\{\}}.

\section{Publications}
\pubforcefullwidth

Demonstrate what an \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}} page looks like.
Also show off the macros for publications that uses small icons for authors, date, journal and links.

Achieving a good looking spacing can be tricky. For empty pagestyles where the full width is available use \texttt{\textbackslash pubforcefullwidth} to force the publoication list to take up all the available space.
The (relative) lengths reserved for date, journal and links can be set with the parameters \texttt{\textbackslash pubdatelength}, \texttt{\textbackslash pubjournallength} and \texttt{\textbackslash publinklength} as in \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash pubdatelength\}\{0.15 \textbackslash linewidth\}}.
